# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

Using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, results from a ride-sharing app "Pyber" were analyzed and then visualized. With larger data sets, using visuals (charts, graphs) communicates results quickly and effectively. The findings of the analysis can be displayed to allow for quick and easy interpretation. Python and Pandas were used to do the data anaylsis and Matplotlib had the tools neccessary to display the findings optimally. 



## Results

The data can be summarized to draw conclusions based on type of ride. As geopgraphy got more rural, presumably, less total rides and total drivers were available. The average fare per rider ($34.62) and average fare per driver ($55.49) were highest at this range. To contrast, at urban locations, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver were $24.53 and $16.57 respectively. Based on the analysis, rides cost more and pay higher as geography gets more rural.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
 
 Based on the results, the CEO has a few different avenues to address disparities:
 
 - Charge a lower fare in rural areas and give the driver a lower fare to more closely match urban areas...
    - Essentially pay rural drivers less and justify by charging less per ride
 - Charge a higher fare in urban areas and give the drivers a higher fare to more closely match rural areas
    - Essentially pay urban drivers more and justify by charging more per ride  
 - Make the average fare per driver directly proportional to the average fare per ride
    - A 'meeting in the middle' solution
